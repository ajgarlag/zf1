        <para>
            There are no limitations for field names in Zend_Search_Lucene.
        </para>

        <para>
            Nevertheless it's good idea not to use '<emphasis>id</emphasis>' and '<emphasis>score</emphasis>' names
            to avoid ambiguity in <code>QueryHit</code> properties names.
        </para>

        <para>
            <code>Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryHit</code> <code>id</code> and <code>score</code> properties always refer
            to internal Lucene document id and hit <link linkend="zend.search.lucene.searching.results-scoring">score</link>.
            If indexed document has the same stored fields, you have to use <code>getDocument()</code> method to access them:

            <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
$hits = $index->find($query);

foreach ($hits as $hit) {
    // Get 'title' document field
    $title = $hit->title;

    // Get 'contents' document field
    $contents = $hit->contents;


    // Get internal Lucene document id
    $id = $hit->id;

    // Get query hit score
    $score = $hit->score;


    // Get 'id' document field
    $docId = $hit->getDocument()->id;

    // Get 'score' document field
    $docId = $hit->getDocument()->score;

    // Another way to get 'title' document field
    $title = $hit->getDocument()->title;

        <title>Indexing performance</title>

        <para>
            Indexing performance is a compromise between used resources, indexing time and index quality.
        </para>

        <para>
            Index quality is completely determined by number of index segments.
        </para>

        <para>
            Each index segment is entirely independent portion of data. So index containing more segments needs
            more memory and more time for searching.
        </para>

        <para>
            Index optimization is a process of merging several segments into new one. Fully optimized index contains
            only one segment.
        </para>

        <para>
            Full index optimization may be performed with 'optimize()' method:
            <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
$index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open($indexPath);

$index->optimize();
]]></programlisting>
        </para>

        <para>
            Index optimization works with data streams and doesn't take a lot of memory, but takes processor resources and time.
        </para>

        <para>
            Lucene index segments are not updatable by their nature (update operation needs segment file
            to be completely rewritten). So adding new document(s) to the index always generates new segment.
            It decreases index quality.
        </para>

        <para>
            Index auto-optimization process is performed after each segment generation and consists in partial segments merging.
        </para>

        <para>
            There are three options to control behavior of auto-optimization
            (see <link id="zend.search.lucene.index-creation.optimization">Index optimization</link> section):
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> is a number of documents buffered in memory before new segment is generated
                          and written to a hard drive.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> is a maximum number of documents merged by auto-optimization process
                          into new segment.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> determines how often auto-optimization is performed.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <note>
                <para>
                    All these options are Zend_Search_Lucene object properties, but not index properties. So they affect only current
                    <code>Zend_Search_Lucene</code> object behavior and may vary for different scripts.
                </para>
            </note>
        </para>

        <para>
            <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> doesn't matter if you index only one document per script execution. To the contrary, it's very important
            for batch indexing. Greater value increases indexing performance, but also needs more memory.
        </para>

        <para>
            There are no way to calculate best value for <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> parameter because it depends on documents size, used
            analyzer and allowed memory.
        </para>

        <para>
            Good way to get right value is to perform several tests with largest document you expect to be added to the index
            <footnote><para><code>memory_get_usage()</code> and <code>memory_get_peak_usage()</code> may be used to control
            memory usage.</para></footnote>. That's good idea not to use more than a half of allowed memory.
        </para>


        <para>
            <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> limits segment size (in terms of documents). So it limits auto-optimization time. That guarantees
            <code>addDocument()</code> method to be not executed more than a certain time. It's important for interactive application.
        </para>

        <para>
            Decreasing <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> parameter also may improve batch indexing performance. Index auto-optimization is iterative process
            and is performed step by step. Small segments are merged into larger, at some moment they are merged into even greater and
            so on. Full index optimization is much more effective.
        </para>

        <para>
            On the over hand, smaller segments decreases index quality and may generate too many segments. It may be a cause of
            the "Too many open files" error determined by OS limitations <footnote><para>Zend_Search_Lucene keeps each segment file opened
            to improve search performance.</para></footnote>.
        </para>

        <para>
            So background index optimization should be performed for interactive indexing mode and <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> shouldn't be
            too low for batch indexing.
        </para>


        <para>
            <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> affects auto-optimization frequency. Less values increases quality of unoptimized index. Larger values increases
            indexing performance, but also increases number of segments. It again may be a cause of the "Too many open files" error.
        </para>

        <para>
            <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> groups index segments by their size:
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem><para>Not greater than <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Greater than <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>, but not greater than
                                <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Greater than <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis>, but not greater than
                <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis>*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>...</para></listitem>
            </orderedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
            Zend_Search_Lucene checks at each <code>addDocument()</code> call if merging of any segments group may move newly created segment
            into next group. If yes, then merging is performed.
        </para>

        <para>
            So index with N groups may contain <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> + (N-1)*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> segments and contains at least
            <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis><superscript>(N-1)</superscript> documents.
        </para>

        <para>
            It gives good approximation for number of segments in the index:
        </para>
        <para>
            <emphasis>NumberOfSegments</emphasis>  &lt;= <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> + <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis>*log
            <subscript><emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis></subscript> (<emphasis>NumberOfDocuments</emphasis>/<emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>)
        </para>

        <para>
            <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> is determined by allowed memory. It gives the possibility to choose appropriate merge factor to get reasonable
            number of segments.
        </para>


        <para>
            Tuning <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> parameter is more effective for batch indexing performance than <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis>. But it's more rough.
            So use above estimation for tuning <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis>, then play with <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> to get best batch indexing performance.
        </para>

        <para>
            It's concerned with buffering added document before generating new segment.

        <para>
            There are two ways which may help to avoid this problem.
        </para>

        <para>
            The first is to force going out of scope:
            <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
$index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open($indexPath);

...

unset($index);
?>]]></programlisting>
        </para>

        <para>
            And the second is to perform commit operation before the end of script execution:
            <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
$index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open($indexPath);

$index->commit();
?>]]></programlisting>
            This possibility is also described in "<link linkend="zend.search.lucene.advanced.static">Advanced. Using index as static property</link>"
